In this set we are going to investigate lists.  As usual, make sure you start
with the standard block of header code we've been using for these challenges.
If you don't do this, you might inadvertently solve these problems in a way
that misses the whole point of the exercise.

1. [Generating combinations](ex3-1.html)
2. [Poker hands](ex3-2.html)
3. [Generalizing pairs and cards](ex3-3.html)
4. [Combinations of three things](ex3-4.html)
5. [Combinations of more things](ex3-5.html)
