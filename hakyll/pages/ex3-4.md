title: Combinations of three things
---

Our allCombs function is more general but it still only lets us generate
combinations of two things.  It is probably not not immediately obvious how to
extend your allCombs function to do that.  First implement an allCombs3
function that generates combinations of 3 things.  Don't try to do anything
fancy yet.  Just use the most straightforward approach you can think of.

    allCombs3 :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [d]

Here is example output to check your function.

    allCombs3 (,,) [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] == [(1,3,5),(1,3,6),(1,4,5),(1,4,6),(2,3,5),(2,3,6),(2,4,5),(2,4,6)]
