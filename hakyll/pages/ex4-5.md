title: Revisiting Other Generic Functions
---

Now that we have our monad type class and an understanding of what motivated it,
go back and rewrite the generic functions from sets 1, 2, and 3 using your monad
type class. But since we're rewriting them generically we need to give them new
names. Here are the functions that you should rewrite and the new names that you
should use. From set 1:

* repRandom (sequence)
* generalB (liftM2)

From set 2:

* chain (=<<)
* yLink (liftM2)
* combine (join)

From set 3:

* allCombs (liftM2)
* allCombs (liftM3)
* combStep (ap)

You only need to write liftM2 once. But instead of using Gen, Maybe, or [] you
use m in its place with the `Monad m` type class constraint. Try to do this set
without looking at the code you used before. Just copy all the type signatures
and redo the work, but this time do everything in terms of return and bind.
