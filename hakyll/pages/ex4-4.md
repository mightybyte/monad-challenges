title: Creating Instances
---

Now you have a Monad type class with two functions: `bind` and `return`.  If
you've heard anything about monads in the past, this might sound familiar.
But don't go off and look at existing monad code yet.  You have a lot more
ground to discover yourself.

The next thing you need to do is create instances of your Monad type class for
the three types we've been working with: `Gen`, `Maybe`, and `[]`. You can do this for
`Maybe` and `[]` with no trouble. But `Gen` won't work because it is a type alias.
First you need to replace your type alias with a `newtype`. Don't go back and
modify your old code. We'll be referring back to that in the future. Do this
work in a new file Set4.hs (again using the same header we've been using and
importing `MCPrelude` instead of Haskell's prelude). You can import Set2 because
that has your `Maybe` data type and associated code which can be reused. But don't
import Set1. When you are finished with this challenge you should have a Set4.hs
file with a Monad type class, a Gen newtype, and three instances.

Along with your Gen newtype you also might want to write a helper function to
make it easier to get your random values out:

    evalGen :: Gen a -> a

If you did all the exercises properly this should be pretty straightforward. The
Monad instance for `Gen` may be a little bit less obvious because this time you'll
have to do some newtype wrangling.

If you need to brush up your knowledge of some of these topics, check out [this
chapter on
newtypes](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword)
or [this chapter on type
classes](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#typeclasses-102)
in Learn You a Haskell.

If you're having trouble with the newtype instance here's a hex encoded code
template to get you started:

Again, if possible try not to use this. We're still leaving the hard bits out.
These things are worth fighting with for awhile.
