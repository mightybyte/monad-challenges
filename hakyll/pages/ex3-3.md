title: Generalizing pairs and cards
---

As we have done before, look at your allPairs and allCards functions and find
the differences.  Then implement a more general function that can be used to
implement both allPairs and allCards.  Call this new function allCombs.

    allCombs :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

Then go back and reimplement allPairs and allCards in terms of allCombs.
Verify that they do the same thing as the original functions.
