We can use the allPairs function to do things like generate poker hands.  In
MCPrelude we have defined two lists called `cardRanks` and `cardSuits`.  Try
calling your allPairs function on these:

    allPairs cardRanks cardSuits == [(2,"H"),(2,"D"),(2,"C"),(2,"S"),(3,"H"),(3,"D"),(3,"C"),(3,"S"),(4,"H"),(4,"D"),(4,"C"),(4,"S"),(5,"H"),(5,"D"),(5,"C"),(5,"S")]

But this isn't a very nice representation.  We want a more concise
representation of the card to show our user.  If you were writing a real
poker-related program, instead of using a tuple you would probably create a
data type Card.  Do that now and then write a Show instance for it that
returns the more concise representation "2H", "2D", etc.

    show (Card 2 "h") == "2h"

Now create a new function allCards that does the same thing as your allPairs
function but uses your new Card data type instead.  It should have the
following type signature:

    allCards :: [Int] -> [String] -> [Card]

This function should do the same thing as allPairs, but with more concise
output.  When you write this function, don't implement it using your previous
allPairs function.  Rewrite it.

    show (allCards cardRanks cardSuits) == "[2H,2D,2C,2S,3H,3D,3C,3S,4H,4D,4C,4S,5H,5D,5C,5S]"
