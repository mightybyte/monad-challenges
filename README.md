# The Monad Challenges

The goal of this project is to provide a roadmap for hands-on exploration and
experimentation with monads. It is still rough and there is a fair amount
content that could be added.

## Contribution Guide

The site is a static site generated with
[Hakyll](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll). To make edits to the text
or to add new sets/exercises, you should edit the markdown files in
[hakyll/pages](https://github.com/mightybyte/monad-challenges/tree/gh-pages/hakyll/pages).
If you have Haskell and Hakyll installed, it is also nice if you can build
site.hs with `ghc --make site.hs` and run the hakyll/regen.sh script to update
the markup. But if it is inconvenient for you to do that, don't worry, we can
easily take care of that part.

If you want to contribute, but don't know what to do, check out the [open
issues](https://github.com/mightybyte/monad-challenges/issues) and see if you
can help with anything there.
