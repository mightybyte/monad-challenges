title: Tailprod
---

Write a function that takes the product of the tail of a list.  Use your
tailMay function and the product function defined in the prelude.

    tailProd :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a

Now write a similar but slightly different function:

    tailSum :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a

These two functions have a lot in common.  See if you can abstract out the
commonality.  You need to write another function that is the generalized
version of both of these.  Spend some time working on this before you look at
the next hint:

Write a function with that type signature and then go back and implement
tailProd and tailSum in terms of that function.

Now that you have that finished, use transMaybe again to write two more
functions tailMax and tailMin. These functions will have different type
signatures than tailProd and tailSum. See if you can figure out what they should
be. If you can't figure it out, here's one.

If you want to make this functions work like you want, you'll need another
helper function. See if you can figure out what the type signature of this
function should be and how to implement it. Call this function `combine`. Here
is its hex encoded type signature if you need help.
